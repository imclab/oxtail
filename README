This is the name parser and standardizer for the datacommons project.
For the moment, it only supports standardizing politician names, and
probably needs a whole bunch of refactoring.

Installation
============

Installation is easy:

    pip install -e git+http://github.com/sunlightlabs/name-cleaver.git#egg=name-cleaver


Upgrading
=========

Upgrading takes a little more work (you'll have to modify this a bit if you're not using virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper):

    pip uninstall name-cleaver
    cdvirtualenv
    rm -rf src/name-cleaver
    pip install -e git+http://github.com/sunlightlabs/name-cleaver.git#egg=name-cleaver
